pseudo code and plan for spaceship game


Home Screen: 

Play Screen:

Start Initialization: 
    Light off -> on
    on platform -> flying




Current plans for next work session:

blender: create tube that will repeat itself
create power up tokens
	speed boost
	coin magnet
	
create coins
	coins can have different movement patterns and different colors
		clump (arranged in a filled hexagonal shape)
		line (can be a moving line) (both x and y direction motions)
generate more interestng tunnel scenes
	options: meteors surrounding
		   techy view: black with blue glowing lines
Generate UI elements for screen
	pause button, pause screen

Things to work on:

the rotation of the ship needs to be limited

new obstacle (could also be used to weld the different pieces of tunnel together (ie the tunnels in subway surfer)): 
- nickname donut
- basically a sphere with a hole in it, the ship needs to fly inside the hole
- rng to determine the size of the hole and the location

Sparks
- using particle system, maybe buy the particle pack or figure out how to make it yourself

experiment with different camera viewing options

add post processing effects : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tjYz6Ab0oc
- may help with powerups as well as making the game look nicer
- definitely look into bloom effect
- use lens distortion to make intro scene with "hyperspace effect

use either linear fog or post processing effects to improve the game look
